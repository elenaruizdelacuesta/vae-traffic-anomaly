    "## Variational Autoencoder (VAE)\n",
    "\n",
    "A **Variational Autoencoder** (VAE) is a type of generative model that learns a continuous, probabilistic latent representation of the data. In our case, the VAE will take a window of traffic sensor readings as input, compress it into a low-dimensional latent vector, and then attempt to reconstruct the original readings. By training the VAE on “normal” traffic patterns, it learns which patterns are likely under the data distribution. At inference time, large reconstruction errors can be flagged as anomalies.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Main Components\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1. **Encoder**\n",
    "The encoder network takes an input (e.g., a time window of traffic data) and maps it to a latent distribution. Instead of directly outputting a single latent vector, the encoder outputs:\n",
    "\n",
    "- A mean vector $\\mu$\n",
    "- A standard deviation (or log variance) vector $\\log(\\sigma^2)$\n",
    "\n",
    "These define a multivariate normal distribution from which we sample the latent variable $z$.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2. **Latent Sampling**\n",
    "To allow backpropagation through the sampling process, VAEs use the **reparameterization trick**:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "z = \\mu + \\sigma \\cdot \\epsilon \\quad \\text{where} \\quad \\epsilon \\sim \\mathcal{N}(0, I)\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "This makes the sampling step differentiable.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 3. **Decoder**\n",
    "The decoder takes the sampled latent variable $z$ and tries to reconstruct the original input data. The goal is to learn a meaningful latent space that can generate realistic reconstructions.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Loss Function\n",
    "\n",
    "The VAE loss has two terms that together form the **Evidence Lower Bound (ELBO)**. We optimize (i.e. minimize) the negative ELBO.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Reconstruction Loss** (e.g., Mean Squared Error):\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\mathcal{L}_{\\text{recon}} = ||x - \\hat{x}||^2\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "> **Why use MSE as reconstruction loss?**\n",
    ">\n",
    "> Theoretically, we want to maximize the log-likelihood of the reconstruction, i.e., $\\log p(x|z)$. If we assume that the decoder’s output is Gaussian with fixed variance (i.e., $p(x|z) = \\mathcal{N}(\\hat{x}, \\sigma^2 I)$), then:\n",
    ">\n",
    "> $$\n",
    "> \\log p(x|z) = -\\frac{1}{2\\sigma^2} ||x - \\hat{x}||^2 + \\text{const}\n",
    "> $$\n",
    ">\n",
    "> So minimizing the squared error (MSE) is equivalent to maximizing the likelihood. That’s why MSE acts as a **proxy** for the negative log-likelihood in practice.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Kullback-Leibler (KL) Divergence**:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\mathcal{L}_{\\text{KL}} = D_{\\text{KL}}(q(z|x) || p(z))\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "This measures how much the learned latent distribution $q(z|x)$ (given by the encoder) deviates from the standard normal prior $p(z) = \\mathcal{N}(0, I)$.\n",
    "\n",
    "> **In practice**, the encoder outputs $\\mu$ and $\\log(\\sigma^2)$, and the KL divergence between the approximate posterior and the prior can be computed in closed form:\n",
    ">\n",
    "> $$\n",
    "> \\mathcal{L}_{\\text{KL}} = -\\frac{1}{2} \\sum \\left(1 + \\log(\\sigma^2) - \\mu^2 - \\sigma^2\\right)\n",
    "> $$\n",
    ">\n",
    "> This encourages the model to keep the latent representations close to a standard normal distribution.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Total Loss\n",
    "\n",
    "The total loss combines both terms:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\mathcal{L}_{\\text{total}} = \\mathcal{L}_{\\text{recon}} + \\beta \\cdot \\mathcal{L}_{\\text{KL}}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $\\beta$ is a hyperparameter (commonly set to 1) that balances reconstruction accuracy and regularization. \n",
    "\n",
    "> **Important:** In theory, we want to **maximize** the Evidence Lower Bound (ELBO), which is:\n",
    ">\n",
    "> $$\n",
    "> \\text{ELBO}(x) = \\mathbb{E}_{q(z|x)}[\\log p(x|z)] - D_{\\text{KL}}(q(z|x) || p(z))\n",
    "> $$\n",
    ">\n",

    "\n",
    "A **LSTM** (Long Short-Term Memory) is a type of recurrent neural network designed to model sequences and capture long-term dependencies through gated mechanisms that control information flow over time.\n",
    "\n",
    "The **CVAE + LSTM** model extends the CVAE by introducing an LSTM that operates in the latent space. The CVAE encodes each timestep of a traffic speed sequence into an embedding; the LSTM then models the temporal evolution of these embeddings, predicting the last window_size-1 embeddings using the first window_size -1 ones. Only the **last predicted embedding** is decoded, summarizing the full sequence for reconstruction.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Trainings** of CVAE and LSTM are kept separate: this improves stability and modularity:\n",
    "* **Decoupled objectives**: The CVAE learns to encode/reconstruct, while the LSTM models temporal dynamics. Joint training can lead to conflicting gradients and unstable convergence.\n",
    "* **Better control**: The encoder can be validated independently for embedding quality before feeding sequences to the LSTM.\n",
    "* **Modularity**: Once trained, components can be reused or replaced independently (e.g., testing different sequence models on the same embeddings).\n",
    "* **Simpler debugging**: Isolating errors or performance issues is easier when training in stages.\n",
    "\n",
    "End-to-end training could be explored later for fine-tuning, once both parts perform well individually {????????????????}\n",
    "\n",
    "> **Why use LSTM inside a CVAE for anomaly detection on traffic speed data?**\n",
    "> VAE works out for indipendent input data, while time series are characterized by innate sequential dependencies. The inception of a LSTM modul inside the original CVAE allows to account for these dependencies.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Main Components\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Encoder (`x`)**: Maps each timestep of input to a latent embedding.\n",
    "* **Condition (`c`)**: Provides context (e.g., time, day type) to guide encoding and decoding.\n",
    "* **LSTM**: Models the sequence of embeddings and predicts the next (last) embedding.\n",
    "* **Decoder**: Reconstructs the final output from the last predicted embedding.\n",
    "\n",
    "### In the next sections\n",
    "\n",
    "First, we present the LSTM model definition, the preprocessing of CVAE-embeddings as LSTM input data,  and the LSTM training over the train data set. The we move to the CVAE_LSTM model definition and we assess its performance over the test dataset {by?????}. Reconstructed time series are plotted. \n",
    "Finally, the score function matrix is build, where scores for each sensor are provided over a customizable window_size. According to a percentile threshold, sensors are flagged as anomalous or not over precise lenght windows."

    "During inference, we feed only the mean vector $\\mu$ to the decoder (by setting `is_code_input=True`). Doing this bypasses the stochastic sampling $z = \\mu + \\sigma \\odot \\epsilon$, making reconstruction fully deterministic. The Gaussian sampling during training regularizes the latent space—encouraging $\\mu \\sim \\mathcal{N}(0,I)$ and preventing overfitting—but is not required at inference time. When the LSTM predicts a latent $\\mu$, we want a stable, reproducible reconstruction; adding noise on each $\\mu$ would yield blurred or random outputs. Using a VAE instead of a standard autoencoder ensures that even unseen $\\mu$ values lie in a well-structured latent space, so the decoder can reliably reconstruct them without stochasticity.\n"
